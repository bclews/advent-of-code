# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Each year, the Advent of Code provides a series of programming puzzles, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year, and each day's solution is stored in its own directory. For example:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ day-01
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # Description of the problem and solution approach
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod            # Go module file
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt         # Puzzle input for the day
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solution          # Compiled solution binary
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solution.go       # Go source code for the solution
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ solution_test.go  # Unit tests for the solution
```

## How to Use
