# Day 16: Reindeer Maze 

## Part One
The Reindeer Olympics feature a maze where the goal is to reach the End Tile with the lowest score. The score increases with each step forward and each 90-degree turn. 

## Part Two
To find the best spot to sit in the maze, determine which tiles are part of the best paths, including S and E tiles. The number of tiles on best paths depends on the maze layout.
