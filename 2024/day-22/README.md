# Day 22: Monkey Market

## Part One

The Historiansâ€™ device is stolen by a monkey, requiring bananas to be traded on the Monkey Exchange Market. To obtain bananas, the protagonist must sell hiding spots to buyers with pseudorandom prices. The protagonist must predict the sequence of secret numbers used by each buyer to determine the best time to sell.

## Part Two

Buyers offer prices based on the last digit of their secret numbers, and the monkey sells when a specific sequence of four price changes occurs. The goal is to find the sequence that yields the most bananas across all buyers.
