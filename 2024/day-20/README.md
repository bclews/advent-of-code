# Day 20: Race Condition

## Part One

The Historians are working on a race condition festival where programs compete to finish a long and twisting code path in the fewest picoseconds.  Programs are allowed to cheat once during the race by disabling collision for up to 2 picoseconds, allowing them to pass through walls. The goal is to find the best cheats that save at least 100 picoseconds.

## Part Two

The cheating rule has been updated to allow a single cheat lasting up to 20 picoseconds.  The goal is to find the best cheats that save at least 100 picoseconds.
