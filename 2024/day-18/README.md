# Day 18: RAM Run

## Part One

You and The Historians are trapped in a computer at the North Pole, with a program corrupting memory spaces. To escape, you must navigate through the corrupted memory, avoiding the falling bytes and reaching the exit.

## Part Two

Historians need to reach the exit before the path is blocked. Determine the coordinates of the first byte that will prevent the exit from being reachable.
