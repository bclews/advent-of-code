# Day 15: Warehouse Woes

## Part One
The lanternfish need help predicting the movements of a rogue robot in their warehouse. The robot’s movements, which may be blocked by boxes or walls, are provided in a sequence. The goal is to calculate the sum of all boxes’ GPS coordinates after the robot completes its movements.

## Part Two
The lanternfish need help with a malfunctioning robot in a wider warehouse. To assist, resize the map by doubling the width of each tile and adjusting the box representation. Calculate the sum of the boxes’ final GPS coordinates after the robot’s movements.
