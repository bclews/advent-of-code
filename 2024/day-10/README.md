# Day 10: Hoof It

## Part One

A reindeer seeks help filling in a topographic map with hiking trails, requiring a specific uphill slope and starting at height 0, ending at 9. The goal is to determine the sum of scores for all trailheads, where a trailheadâ€™s score is the number of reachable 9-height positions.

## Part Two

Trailhead rating is the number of distinct hiking trails starting at that point. The reindeer marks trailheads on the map with flags, and the sum of all trailhead ratings is 81.
