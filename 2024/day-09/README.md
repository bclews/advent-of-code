# Day 09: Disk Fragmenter

## Part One

The Historians are piloting mini submarines while the narrator helps an amphipod compact his disk. The disk map, representing file and free space lengths, requires rearranging file blocks to the leftmost free space. The final step involves calculating the filesystem checksum by multiplying block positions by file IDs.

## Part Two

Amphipodâ€™s new plan involves moving whole files to the leftmost free space, prioritizing files by decreasing ID numbers. The goal is to compact the filesystem and improve performance.
