# Day 12: Garden Groups

## Part One

The Historians encounter a map of garden plots and must calculate the cost of fencing each region. The cost is determined by multiplying the area by the perimeter of each region, considering the number of garden plots and their connections. The total cost of fencing all regions on the map is the sum of individual region costs.

## Part Two

Elves qualify for a bulk discount on fence, where price is calculated by multiplying area by the number of sides of each region. The number of sides is determined by counting each straight section of fence, regardless of length. This new method results in different total prices for various maps, requiring careful consideration of region shapes and fence connections.
