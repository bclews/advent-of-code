# Day 02: Red-Nosed Reports

--- Part One: Historian Hysteria ---
The Historians are searching for the Chief Historian at the Red-Nosed Reindeer plant. Engineers need help analyzing unusual data from the reactor, which consists of reports with levels that must be either increasing or decreasing by 1, 2, or 3 to be considered safe.

--- Part Two ---
The Problem Dampener module allows unsafe reports to be considered safe if removing a single level would make them safe.
