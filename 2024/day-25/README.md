# Day 25: Code Chronicle

## Part One

The Historians, facing a locked door, seek help from North Pole security, who provide schematics of locks and keys.  The schematics, representing lock and key shapes, reveal that some key/lock combinations cannot fit due to overlapping columns.  The goal is to find the number of unique lock/key pairs that fit without overlap.

## Part Two

The Chief Historian, having fallen asleep while working on a chronicle for Santa, realizes heâ€™s running out of time to complete it before the sleigh launch. With the help of The Historians, who have been documenting their journey, they gather their notes and prepare the chronicle for delivery to Santa.
