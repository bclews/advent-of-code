# Day 19: Linen Layout

## Part One

The Historians search for helixes on Gear Island while the narrator seeks entry to an onsen. The onsen staff, impressed by the narratorâ€™s assistance, offer free admission if they can arrange towels to match desired designs. The narrator must determine how many designs are possible using the provided towel patterns.

## Part Two

Staff dislike towel arrangements, so provide all options. Calculate the total number of ways to arrange towels for each design.
