# Day 06: Guard Gallivant

## Part One
Historians travel back in time to 1518 to find the Chief in a North Pole lab. To avoid time paradoxes, they need to predict the guard’s patrol route to search safely. The guard follows a strict protocol, turning right if there’s an obstacle ahead and taking a step forward otherwise.

## Part Two
The Historians need help finding safe positions for an obstruction to trap the lab guard in a loop.
