# Day 08: Resonant Collinearity

## Part One

Antennas with the same frequency create antinodes, with two created by two antennas and four by three. Antennas with different frequencies do not create antinodes, but antinodes can occur at locations containing antennas.

## Part Two

Resonant harmonics cause antinodes to occur at grid positions aligned with two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance. This results in additional antinodes, including those at the positions of the antennas themselves.
