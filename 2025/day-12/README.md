# Day 12: Christmas Tree Farm

The Elves need help determining which regions under Christmas trees can fit all their required presents. Each present has a specific polyomino shape (defined by `#` cells, where `.` represents empty space that doesn't block other presents), and each region is a rectangular grid that needs to accommodate specific quantities of each shape. Presents can be rotated and flipped to fit, but the `#` parts of different presents cannot overlap. The challenge is to count how many regions can successfully fit all their required presents.
