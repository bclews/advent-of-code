# Day 10: Factory

## Part One

Factory machines need to be initialized by configuring their indicator lights to match specific patterns. Each machine has indicator lights (initially all off) and buttons that toggle specific lights. Each button can be pressed multiple times, and pressing a button toggles all its associated lights between on and off. The goal is to find the minimum total number of button presses required to configure all machines' indicator lights to their target patterns.

## Part Two

With the machines online, the focus shifts to configuring joltage levels rather than indicator lights. Each machine has counters (initially all zero) and the same buttons, but now each button press increments (rather than toggles) its associated counters by 1. The goal is to find the minimum total number of button presses required to set all machines' counters to their exact target joltage values.
