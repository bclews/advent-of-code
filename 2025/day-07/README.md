# Day 7: Laboratories

## Part One

You're trapped in a teleporter lab and need to fix a malfunctioning tachyon manifold. A tachyon beam enters at position S and travels downward. When it hits a splitter (^), the beam stops and creates two new beams that continue from the immediate left and right positions. Count how many times the beam is split as it travels through the manifold.

## Part Two

The manifold is actually quantum, meaning a single tachyon particle takes both the left and right path at every splitter simultaneously, creating separate timelines. Using the many-worlds interpretation, count the total number of different timelines that exist after the particle completes all possible journeys through the manifold.
