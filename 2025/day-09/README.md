# Day 9: Movie Theater

## Part One

The movie theater floor contains red tiles at specific coordinates given in the puzzle input. The task is to find the largest rectangle that uses any two red tiles as opposite corners. Any pair of red tiles can be chosen to form a rectangle, and the goal is to maximize the area by testing all possible pairs.

## Part Two

The Elves can only use red or green tiles for the rectangle. The red tiles in the input list form a closed polygon where consecutive tiles are connected by straight lines of green tiles (with wraparound from the last to the first tile). All tiles inside this polygon boundary are also green, while tiles outside are neither red nor green. The task is to find the largest rectangle with red tiles at opposite corners that is entirely contained within the polygon formed by red and green tiles.
