# Day 4: Printing Department

## Part One

The printing department has rolls of paper (@) arranged on a grid. Forklifts can only access a roll of paper if there are fewer than four rolls in the eight adjacent positions. The goal is to count how many rolls of paper can be accessed by a forklift in the initial configuration.

## Part Two

Once accessible rolls are removed, more rolls may become accessible. The challenge is to determine the total number of rolls that can be removed if we keep repeating the process until no more rolls are accessible by a forklift.
