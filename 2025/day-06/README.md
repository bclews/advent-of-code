# Day 6: Trash Compactor

## Part One

While trapped in a trash compactor, you help a young cephalopod with math homework. The worksheet contains problems arranged in vertical columns separated by spaces, with numbers stacked vertically and an operator (\* or +) at the bottom. Read each problem's numbers horizontally across rows, apply the operator, and sum all problem results to get the grand total.

## Part Two

The cephalopods explain that their math is actually read right-to-left, with each column representing a single number (digits stacked top-to-bottom, most significant digit at top). Now you must read vertically down each column to form numbers, apply the operator for each problem, and sum the results for a new grand total.
