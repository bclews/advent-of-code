# Day 3: Lobby

## Part One

In this puzzle, the lobby’s elevators and escalator are offline, and you must power the escalator using emergency batteries arranged in banks. Each bank is a line of digits, and you must choose exactly two batteries from each line to form the largest possible two-digit number using their original order. After determining each bank’s maximum joltage—such as 98 from 987654321111111 or 89 from 811111111111119—you sum all these best outputs to get the total emergency power.

## Part Two

In part two, the escalator still won’t run, so the Elf overrides its safety limit, requiring each battery bank to output a much larger number by activating exactly twelve batteries instead of two. You must select the twelve digits within each bank that form the largest possible 12-digit number while preserving their original order. Using the same four example banks, this means keeping the highest-value digits and discarding lower ones—typically many of the 1s—to form outputs like 987654321111 or 811111111119. Summing all maximum 12-digit outputs from the banks yields a dramatically larger total joltage.
